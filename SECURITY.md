## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting a Vulnerability
We take the security of our project seriously and encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.
If you discover a security issue, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible and coordinated manner. 
Please follow these guidelines when reporting a vulnerability:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#How to Report
To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to "146196173+bohoul@users.noreply.github.com" with a detailed description of the issue. We recommend encrypting your email using our PGP key to ensure the confidentiality of the information.
#Response Time
Once we receive your report, we will acknowledge its receipt within [3 business days]. Our security team will then assess the severity of the issue and initiate the necessary steps to address it.

#Vulnerability Assessment
Our team will review the reported vulnerability and, if necessary, conduct further investigation. You may be contacted for additional information or clarification during this process.

#Resolution
If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will develop and test a fix. The timeline for resolution will vary depending on the complexity and severity of the issue. We will keep you informed of our progress and expected release dates for fixes.

#Public Disclosure
We follow a responsible disclosure policy, which means that we will not disclose the details of the vulnerability until a fix is available and users have had a reasonable opportunity to apply the update. We appreciate your patience and cooperation in maintaining the security of our project.

#Vulnerability Acceptance or Decline
Our team will make a decision regarding the acceptance or decline of the reported vulnerability based on its severity and impact. If accepted, credit will be given to the reporter in our security advisories or release notes (if requested).

#Legal Protections
We will not pursue legal action against security researchers who act in good faith and follow responsible disclosure practices.

Thank you for helping us make our project more secure. Your contributions to its security are greatly valued.
